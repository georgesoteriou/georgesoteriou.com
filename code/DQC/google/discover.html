<p>Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware. [1]</p>

<p>Google starts its research with quantom computing in 2009 by collaborating with D-Wave Systems on image search technology. Since 2014, they officially starts their research with quantum computing associated with hardware, alogrithms and A.I.. In 2015, Google, using an array of 9 superconducting qubits developed by the Martinis group and UCSB, simulates a hydrogen molecule.</p>

<p>Google purchased its D-Wave computer in 2013 to figure out whether it could be used to improve search results and artificial intelligence. The following year, the firm hired John Martinis at the University of California, Santa Barbara, to design its own superconducting qubits. “His qubits are way higher quality,” says Aaronson.[3]</p>

<p>At the end of 2017, a team of physicists at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) and Google have demonstrated a proof-of-principle for a quantum computer. The team’s plan, then, wasn’t to create a fully functional quantum computer, but to instead create a system that can support 49 qubits in superposition reliably.[2] Their goal, audaciously named quantum supremacy, is to build the first quantum computer capable of performing a task no classical computer can.[3]</p>

<p>If the team is right, they may achieve quantum supremacy in a matter of months. We can expect to see machine learning take place exponentially faster, and artificial intelligence progress much more rapidly.</p>

<p>To push classical computing to the limit, Google turned to Edison, one of the most advanced supercomputers in the world, housed at the US National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. Google had it simulate the behaviour of quantum circuits on increasingly larger grids of qubits, up to a 6 × 7 grid of 42 qubits.[3]</p>

<p>the plan of engineers from google
“We study the task of sampling from the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural task for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution classically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with computational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is typical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime using extensive supercomputer simulations, modeling circuits with up to 42 qubits - the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational task that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are extremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the near-term with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross entropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the circuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured when circuit simulations are available. Beyond the classically tractable regime, the cross entropy can be extrapolated and compared with theoretical estimates of circuit fidelity to define a practical quantum supremacy test. “[4]</p>

<p>Now that Google and other companies involved in quantum computing have mastered much of the fundamental science behind creating high-quality superconducting qubits, the big challenge facing these firms is scaling these systems and reducing their error rates.[5]</p>

<p>“They are definitely the world leaders now, there is no doubt about it. It’s Google’s to lose. If Google’s not the group that does it, then something has gone wrong.”
—- Simon Devitt at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science in Japan.</p>

<p>“It’s a blueprint for what they’re planning to do in the next couple of years.”
—  Scott Aaronson at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>

<p>“They’re doing a quantum version of chaos.The output is essentially random, so you have to compute everything.”
— says Devitt</p>

<p>“I think this is achievable within two or three years. They’ve showed concrete steps on how they will do it.”
—  Matthias Troyer at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.</p>

<p>“I’m going to be optimistic and say maybe at the end of next year.If they get it done even within the next five years, that will be a tremendous leap forward.”
— Simon Devitt at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science in Japan.</p>

<p>“It might be a thing that causes people to say, if we want a full-scalable quantum computer, let’s talk numbers: how many billions of dollars?” 
— Scott Aaronson at the University of Texas at Austin.</p>

<p>“It’s absolutely progress to building a fully scalable machine.”
—- Ian Walmsley at the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>“Once a system hits quantum supremacy and is showing clear scale-up behaviour, it will be a flare in the sky to the private sector. It’s ready to move out of the labs.”
— Simon Devitt at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science in Japan.</p>

<p>“The field is moving much faster than expected. It’s time to move quantum computing from science to engineering and really build devices.”
— Matthias Troyer at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.</p>

<p>“Things really have moved much quicker than I would have expected.” 
— Simon Devitt at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia.</p>

<p>“Press releases always talk about quantum space race in number of qubits. It’s more than just quantity, it’s qubit quality more on that in just a bit.
—  John Martinis, University of California, Santa Barbara physicist</p>
